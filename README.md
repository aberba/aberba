# Hi there

I'm Lawrence, a full stack web engineer. I enjoy to **design and code** using React.Js, Node.js and [D](https://dlang.org). You may check out [my portfolio](https://aberba.com/portfolio) to see some of my work. I also occasionally [blog about stuff](https://aberba.com) too.

Aside work, I also have these side projects:
* [Nnipa.app](https://nnipa.app): A work-in-progress SaaS application for sales businesses in Ghana to acquire, manage and communicate with customers.
* [Promoting D](https://github.com/aberba/getting-started-with-d): I believe D is a wonderful programming language many people need to use. It strikes a balance between being extremely powerful but also a joy to use... making it hard to not use it subsequently for everything!
* [Open Twi](https://github.com/aberba/open-twi): Helping translate modern technologies into Twi language, spoken mostly in Ghana.
